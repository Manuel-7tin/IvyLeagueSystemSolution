- Tried to verify email by clicking on the link, instead of it to tell me the email is verified it asked me to put the email in. ✅
- After putting the email in and clicking verify email it did nothing, just reloaded and asked me to put the email agian, except this time, i can't type. and although i can't type the text is still there ❌
- As a result **Email verificationn is not working.** ✅❌
- We have not worked on declined transactions, it just does nothing.
- Why are we requesting for the users email alongside new password when reseting? ❌

## Less urgent fixes
- The system says `you are signed in, click to go to dashboard.` But we should just take them there directly.✅

- Ping backend thing (Almost forgot this) ⏸️
